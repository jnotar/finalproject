Pseudocode

Project Idea

Compare known vision-related sequences (opsins, rhodopsins, PAX-6) from many echinoderm species, particularly in Echinoidea (e.g. Strongylocentrotus sp., Centrostephanus sp., Dendraster sp., Lytechinus sp., Lovenia sp., Mesocentrotus sp., some Ophiuriod/Asteroid/Holothuroid species, etc.).

Steps: 

-Use GenBank to look up predicted sequences in several echinoderm species, use webscraping.
#Search Genbank for all Echinoid species + opsin/rhodopsin/PAX-6

-Compare the transcripts for similarity, by BLASTing them against each other.
#BLAST sequences
#find a way to automate this in GenBank

#use webscraping to take the % similarity
#put similarities into a table 

#Use ETE Toolkit in Python to compare sequence similarity visually
#download sequences from GenBank
#import into ETE Toolkit
	#sequences
	#phylogenetic tree
	#names

-Compare these results to see if they match the known phylogenetic relationships and/or habitat type.
